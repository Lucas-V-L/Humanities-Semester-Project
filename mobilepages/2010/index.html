<h1>The Mobile Web</h1>
<p>With Apple's release of the iPhone, and their decision to omit Flash from the default web browser [credible source], it marked the beginning of the end for flash. Apple believed that flash would significantly harm the battery life and security of the iPhone, and opted for it's new modern counterpart -- Javascript. allowing for direct interaction with the html content of a page, and being built in to every modern browser [browser compatibility chart internet archive link], everything was in favor of javascript becoming the new standard.</p>
<p>not only was javascript better from a technology standpoint, but it made use with screenreaders and other accessibility tools much easier. where flash was its own window, screenreader tools could not access flash content, so it was incredibly difficult for the sight impaired to use the internet. however, as Javascript simply complemented the existing HTML, screenreader tools could much more effectively function.

<p>another benefit of javascript was loading time. rather than bundle a large flash application package with the website, javascript was much more minimal, and therefore reduced loading time and data usage on the commonly limited data plans of the time. JavaScript was also better in this regard than simple static pages as it could update the content of a page with minimal to no loading of new pages. this made the web feel more like the apps which users were becoming accustomed to with no delay betewwn button presses and therefore a more simple and easy to understand user interface [study on delay and user friendlyness???]</p>
