	<h1>Before You enter...</h1>
	<p>Please read the following for clarification</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If at any time you would like to zoom the page, please be advised that the zoom function built in to your browser will not produce the expected behavior - it will only zoom the citation text. I have developed a solution for this myself, on every page on the top right of the screen a zoom in and zoom out button can be found. please use them to zoom the page to the desired size.</li>
		<li>I ran out of time. Yes, i had the entire semester, i did use all of it, i just bit off a lot more than i could chew. not all of the pages are complete, but i have made sure to somewhat finish the ones which mark important points in history in my rushed attempt to get as much as i could done as fast as i could. the past few weeks have been incredibly hectic for me, and it was hard for me to find the time to work on my project as not only do i have a plethora of other classes to do homewrok, practice speeches, and make presentations for, but i also have many out of school commitments such as Boy Scouts (I am a patrol leader). this was exemplified by the fact that i could only effectively do work from my home system, as i cannot code, test, write, and edit images simultaneously on one laptop monitor. Yes, these are excuses, but i say this for no other reason than to emphasize that it was not a lack of effort which lead the project to this point</li>
		<li>i chose this style of project because writing is very much not my strong point. a <i><b>significant</b></i> amount of the effort in this project was put into the styling of the pages to communicate my claim through visual and interactive means rather than in text</li>
		<li>The source code to the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Lucas-V-L/Humanities-Semester-Project">Here</a>, this is not something you need to look at to understand the project, but it is worthwhile to glance it over and see all the behind the scenes stuff if that interests you</li>
		<li>At the top of the page you will find a small tab which includes two links and a year number to navigate through time, click next or previous to move between pages</li>
		<li>The bottom of the page features an arrow button which will open the citation drawer - use this to view the citations for that specific page</li>
		<li>Inside of the simulated pages will be citations consisting of numbers in brackets like so: [1]. these numbers are clickable and will open the citation drawer plus highlight the appropriate citation. the citation drawer can be closed again the same way as normal with the down arrow at the top</li>
		<li>I have put too much time into this project to simply stop working on it, if you check back in the future you will most likely find the site has evolved from the version you are currently grading</li>
		<li>The purpose of this website is to demonstrate and explain the impact of changing technologies on the accessebility of the web, both to people with impairements and to the average person using the internet. <b>The evolution of the technologies which power the World Wide Web have greatly improved the accesebility of the Web</b></li>
		<li>Lastly, i do not have an easy means to run this through a spellchecker, and this was all very rushed, there are going to be a plethora of typos.</li>
		<li>With all that said, <a href="1995.html">Click Here</a> to enter the first page</li>
