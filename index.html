	<h1>Attention!</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>The purpose of this page is to demonstrate how the evolution of interactive technologies on the web have made it more and less accessible over time. my claim is that overall, while there are faults with the current state of interactive tech, they do overall make the experience more accessible</li>
		<li>Many parts of this project will not be formal, some parts will be -- that is a <b>choice</b>, not a fault. some pages from the mid 90's and early 2000's will be styled in the form of a personal blog accurate to the time period, others will be in the style of a modern day article, some may look fine, others may look awful, and there are parts which use styling which i use on personal pages such as the main <a href="https://lucasvl.nl/">lucasvl.nl</a>, not that that is noticeable at this stage of the project, there will be very little actual content.</li>
		<li>This is a work in progress, nowhere near finished, think of it like a piece sanded with 24-grit sandpaper</li>
		<li>All images not explicitely credited are public domain. any credit/citation will either be in the form of a popup (click image for popup, used in images where in-text citation is impractical), a link under the image, or a superscript which opens a popup to the corresponding part of the works-cited.</li>
		<li>I am using a code editor which does not include a spell checker, I will spellcheck everything with external tools before final submission, but for now I'm just doing it the old fashioned way.</li>
		<li>Appreciate the simple things, i am not a fan of fancy frameworks, graphical tools, or other modern methods of making websites. this is not like google sites or wix where you can drag and drop certain aspects and make a simple page in 10 minutes, i am doing this the intended way designed by Tim Berners Lee in 1993 (immagine it as you sill, like constructing a car with nothing but a sharp rock and a pointy stick) this simple layout took hours to do so any time you notice a little animation or something centered both vertically and horizontally, just know that took time, more than you would expect.</li>
		<li>This project is my first time using JavaScript and ActionScript, while that aspect is not currently implemented, expect it to be imperfect at best once it is</li>
		<li>This page will be updated continually, check back any time to view progress!</li>
		<li>if at any point you wish to view the code for a specific portion of a page, right click and view source. from there you can look for a "style.css" in the &lt;head&gt; portion of the page and click it for the other code, any link encapsulated in an iframe tag will also lead to more code. i will post a github link in the near future to simplify code viewing as i intend to also write some backend code in flask which would not be viewable in this manner.</li>
