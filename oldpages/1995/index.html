<h1>Welcome to the Internet of 1995!</h1>

<p>
The internet is still new, unknown, and confusing. Not many people truly understand quite what it is. The web was originally intended as a way to exchange documents, and thats what it still does.<a onclick="source('two')">[2]</a> The internet is powered by a document format called HTML, standing for HyperText Markup Language, built for HTTP, the HyperText Transmision Protocol. At the moment there is very little in the way of interactive technology, which means two things. while it is less accessible to the average person, it does actually improve accessibility for disabled persons using a screenreader<a onclick="source('six')">[6]</a>, however, screenreaders were uncommon at the time, and the real issue was getting regular people on the internet. one big leap was the advent of CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets. as the name implies, CSS allowed for the styling of HTML meaning web developers could get more creative with their websites, creating easy to use side navigation menus or flashy <span class="flashybutton">click me!</span> buttons.<a onclick="source('eight')">[8]</a> HTML without CSS is simply black text on a white background and nothing more, with CSS however, you get what you are viewing right now. CSS also made the web more appealing to creators who could now put creativity into their pages. It incentivised people to make more websites, meaning there was more of a reason for people to visit the web, and more of a reason for people to check out what the internet even is. This increase in visual appeal through CSS made the internet much more appealing and accessible for the average user <a onclick="source('five')">[5]</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Java Applets were also intoduced at this time.<a onclick="source('four')">[4]</a> Shipped with release 1.0 of Java, Java Applets were a way for website developers to embed full fledged Java applications into their websites.<a onclick="source('nine')">[9]</a> This was the technology which the very first version of the hit game Minecraft was built atop before it transitioned to focus on desktop Java <a onclick="source('seven')">[7]</a>. While Java applets saw moderate success at the time, they were not yet widely used as they required a special browser to run, and were more of a &#34;proof of concept&#34; for an interactive web than anything else<a onclick="source('three')">[3]</a>.
